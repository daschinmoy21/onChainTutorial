# 🧱 Blockchain Identity Ledger

This project is a **hands-on demonstration** of how a blockchain works.

Instead of learning blockchain only through theory, this project allows you to:

* Interact with a **real blockchain running locally**
* See how data is written as **transactions**
* Observe how information becomes **permanent and publicly readable**

> **The goal is understanding, not complexity.**

## 🧠 What does this project do?

The project simulates a **public identity ledger**.

* Users can submit a simple identity entry (like a name)
* Each submission is recorded as a **real blockchain transaction**
* Transactions are grouped into **blocks**
* Once added, entries **cannot be edited or removed**
* Anyone can view the **entire history of entries**

There are **no accounts, wallets, or tokens involved** — only data and history.
